      <description>/* this chunnk of code centers all of the headings */ h1, h2, h3 { text-align: center; }  Modeling Census Tract Level Evictions: Correlates Of Eviction Rates The sociodemographic variables shown, including race and income, mirror the spatial relationships seen in eviction rates. In this section, we use a regression model to study whether and how eviction rates are affected by these variables. We find that the following variables are significantly associated with eviction rates.</description>

The Eviction Intensity Index we created from our regression model was used to rank all census tracts in U.S. cities that are comparable in size to Richmond. The word cloud below visualizes the frequency that census tracts with the words “Richmond City” show up in a list of the top 320 most eviction intense tracts in the U.</description>

      <description>We determined that state level landlord and tenant friendly policies are significantly associated with tract-level eviction rates. These finding suggested that state level policy levers such as:
 Laws that reduce protected class exemptions in housing-related transactions, Laws that protect tenants from retaliation by landlords Laws that reduce the number of exemptions landlords have from state landlord-tenant law  can affect evictions rates.
Positive values of the eviction intensity indicator show there are still census tracts where eviction rates are not fully explained by sociodemographic and state level policy variables.</description>
