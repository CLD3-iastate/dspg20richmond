<h2>2020 Richmond City Project inst</h2>
<p>The city of Richmond has one of the highest eviction rates in the United States.</p>
<div id="project-goals" class="section level3" style="text-align:center">
<h3>Project Goals</h3>
<p>This project aims to help Virginia Cooperative Extension (VCE) carefully target their nutrition and financial literacy programs to the areas of highest need within the city of Richmond.</p>
</div>
<div id="our-approach" class="section level3" style="text-align:center">
<h3>Our Approach</h3>
<p>The VT-DSPG program partnered with VCE to first identify the factors that predict eviction. Then used this information to develop an eviction vulnerability index which maps socio-economic determinants of eviction at the census tract level.</p>

<div id="goal" class="section level3">
<h3>Goal:</h3>
<p>Measure and map the urban capital available by census tract within the city, with a focus on those tracts with the highest eviction rates. Create dashboard of urban capital metrics. Find the correlation between eviction rate data and capital metrics.</p>
<ul>
<li>Step 1: Find cities with similar demographic factors, like population, median income, etc.<br />
</li>
<li>Step 2: compare other factors of interest, such as city-level policies between Richmond and similar cities.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="research-question" class="section level3">
<h3>Research question:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Census tract level: Which census tracts have the most serious eviction problem? Does the distribution relate to urban capital?</li>
<li>City level: Why is the eviction rate so high in Richmond city?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Eviction literature</h3>
<p>Oftentimes the convergence of housing demand and supply has reduced the meaning of living to a mere consumption need that can be satisfied in the market like every other need. <strong>Living is indeed a process that involves individuals and their actions and relationships.</strong> To better understand the framework of the many complex aspects of living, and consequently of eviction, we should consider the strong implications that living has with the surrounding environment.</p>

<p>Consequences of eviction:</p>
<ul>
<li>Poverty increase</li>
<li>Lower quality education</li>
<li>Lower safety</li>
<li>Lower quality education</li>
<li>Lower safety</li>
</ul>

<div id="regression-model" class="section level3" style="text-align:center">
<h3>Regression model</h3>
<p>To study eviction we created a regression model that combines the influx of sociodemographic variables such as poverty rate, ethnicity, education level, together with the effect of policies and the median household income.</p>
<p>We focus on the features that can help us explain the diverse geographies and the displacement modes together with the influx that such variables have and the linkage among them.</p>
