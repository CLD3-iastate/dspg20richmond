      <description>2020 Richmond City Summer Project Data and Methodology This research uses data from The Eviction Lab at Princeton University, a project directed by Matthew Desmond and designed by Ashley Gromis, Lavar Edmonds, James Hendrickson, Katie Krywokulski, Lillian Leung, and Adam Porton. The Eviction Lab is funded by the JPB, Gates, and Ford Foundations as well as the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. More information is found at evictionlab.org. For our primary data source, we used the Eviction Lab’s records on evictions at the 2010 census tract level for all cities.</description>

      <description>2020 Richmond City Project inst The city of Richmond has one of the highest eviction rates in the United States.
Project Goals This project aims to help Virginia Cooperative Extension (VCE) carefully target their nutrition and financial literacy programs to the areas of highest need within the city of Richmond.
Our Approach The VT-DSPG program partnered with VCE to first identify the factors that predict eviction. Then used this information to develop an eviction vulnerability index which maps socio-economic determinants of eviction at the census tract level.</description>
