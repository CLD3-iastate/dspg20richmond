### 2020 Richmond City Project {style=text-align:center}

The city of Richmond has one of the highest eviction rates in the United States. 
### Project Goals {style=text-align:center}

This project aims to help Virginia Cooperative Extension (VCE) carefully target their nutrition and financial literacy programs to the areas of highest need within the city of Richmond.

### Our Approach {style=text-align:center}

The VT-DSPG program partnered with VCE to first identify the factors that predict eviction. Then used this information to develop an eviction vulnerability index which maps socio-economic determinants of eviction at the census tract level.
