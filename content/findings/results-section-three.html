<h2>Discussion and Next Steps</h2>
<p>We determined that state level landlord and tenant friendly policies are significantly associated with tract level eviction rates. These finding suggested that state level policy levers such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Laws that reduce protected class exemptions in housing-related transactions,</li>
<li>Laws that protect tenants from retaliation by landlords,</li>
<li>Laws that reduce the number of exemptions landlords have from state landlord-tenant law can affect evictions rates.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Modeling Census Tract Level Evictions: Visualization of socio-demographic variables and eviction rates in Richmond 2013-2018</h2>
<p>To provide further guidance for policymakers interested in understanding evictions in Richmond, we provide a dashboard that can be used to visualize the socio-demographic variables that our statistical model identified as being associated with eviction rates. This dashboard provides some context for what we can observe about the city of Richmond and the variation across census tracts and time.</p>
<p>In the visualization below, we have an eviction indicator for census tracts in the city of Richmond.</p>
