### Main Findings 

Compared to the reference population as described in [Data and Methodology](https://boya66.github.io/Richmond_website/methods/), estimates of a unit increase in the following variables were associated with increases in the squared root eviction rate: 

* The number of protected class exemptions in housing-related transactions in state law and 0.3935, 
* Whether tenants in the state are protected from retaliation by landlords after asserting their legal rights and 0.2037, 
* Number of exemptions landlords have from state landlord-tenant law and 0.1267,
* Percentage of tract that is Black or African American and not Hispanic or Latino (2011-2016 ACS) and 0.01006, 
* Percentage of tract aged 16+ who are unemployed and 0.0215, and tract poverty rate and 0.0046.

A unit increase in the following variables were associated with decreases in the squared root eviction rate: 

* The number of total legal remedies available to tenants in state law and -0.8689, * The number of total legal remedies available to landlords in state law and -0.4012, 
* Percentage of tract aged 25+ with a bachelor’s degree or higher and -0.0106, 
* Percentage of tract that is Asian and -0.0019, percentage of tract that is Hispanic and -0.0011. 

The model’s adjusted R-squared was 0.6904, with an F-statistic of 70.84 on 83 and 2516 degree of freedom, with a residual standard error of 0.4703. 

### Conclusion and Policy Implications 

We determined that policy changes were the most important type of factor in understanding eviction rates, while most demographic factors may play a more limited role. The factor most highly associated with increased eviction rates was the number of protected class exemptions in the state, while the factor most highly associated with decreased eviction rates was total legal remedies available to tenants in the state. 

These results provide evidence that state tenant-landlord law, and potentially other policy impacting this relationship and its associated transactions, is important in explaining eviction rates. The evidence of relationships provided in this analysis should inform future decision making in eviction and housing policymaking. Particularly for policy makers intending to reduce eviction rates, the following recommendations may be prudent for future study:

* Reduce number of protected class exemptions in housing-related transactions in state law
* Protect tenants from retaliation by landlords
* Reduce the number of exemptions landlords have from state landlord-tenant law 
* Increase the number of total legal remedies available to tenants and landlords in state law
